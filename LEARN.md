## Profile Readme

A GitHub profile README is a feature of GitHub that allows users to use a Markdown file named README to write details about themselves such as their skills, interests, GitHub stats and showcase it to the GitHub community. It's shown at the top of your GitHub home page, above the pinned repositories. This is a fancy way to showcase one's skills and stats on GitHub.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Technologies 🖥️

This is a brief section detailing the technologies (programming languages, IDE's, etc...) that you use in a normal basis.

### Icons 👻

You can embed the icons of the technologies that you use.
In my readme, i use the icons found at [Badges-4-Readme](https://github.com/alexandresanlim/Badges4-README.md-Profile.git), a repository that provides a lot of icons related with programming languages, frameworks, IDE's, social media, etc.

Other common icons oftenly used in readme profiles are:
* [Skill Icons](https://github.com/tandpfun/skill-icons)
* [DevIcons](https://github.com/devicons/devicon.git) 

## Github Stats 📈

Dynamically generated stats for your personal use in GitHub.

### Card Stats 📈

My readme uses [Github Readme Stats](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats.git) in order to provide dinamically generated data about my most used programming languages, streak, commits, and other general Github Stats.


### WakaTime 🕛

Wakatime is a plugin that you can install in most of your IDE's in order to monitor the time that you spend on each one of them. 
The WakaTime implementation is also powered by the [Github Readme Stats](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats.git) repository.
